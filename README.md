Created a client program that will connect with the server program. The server program reads in a file that contains majors and their  average early career and midcareer pays. The client program will send the server program requests for the average early career and midcareer pays for a specific college major. The server program waits for connection requests from the client program and once it accepts it, the server program displays the request. If the major is not in the table, then 2 negative values are displayed. The program ends when the user inputs an empty string.
